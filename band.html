          <div id = "here"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first heard Kanye West's new album, TLOP, on February 11th during the live stream reveal. I don't think I've ever been more drawn to a song right off the bat as I was for Ultralight Beam. For it's simple structure and instrumentation, it hits so hard. I called my brother right after the stream and told him we absolutely had to cover the track. 12 hours later I was back home in Belmont, with my good friend and drummer Hunter Bragg in tow, working through an arrangement with the rest of the guys. We knew that there was no point in going for the same feel - we didn't exactly have gospel choir on our hand. So, we tried our best to make it our own. Hope you enjoy! Update: It's racked up over 16000 views! </div>

          <div id = "my"> Debut Album  </div>

          <div id = "here"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently working on our debut album. We launched a Kickstarter in July 2016 to fund our professionally recorded album, and successfully raised $8,790 with the help of 125 backers! Since then we've been recording our originals in Tiny Telephone studio in SF. It's been an incredible experience - my first time in a studio - and I can't wait to get the music out! In the meantime, check out our KickStarter Promo Video.

          <div id = "here"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wrote a pump-up anthem for our sister Justine Fedronic who competed in the 2016 Rio Olympics as an 800 meter runner. We debuted the song at our July 30th show at the historic Boom Boom Room in San Francisco.

          <div id = "here"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More Fatter is a funk/rock/jazz fusion band hailing from Belmont, California in the San Francisco Bay Area. With spacious, brassy dance grooves reminiscent of Earth Wind & Fire and lusciously tight harmonies inspired by The Beatles, More Fatter draws from a well of classic rock and funk. Further building on modern influences ranging from Snarky Puppy, to Justin Timberlake, to Chicago-based Sidewalk Chalk, More Fatter carves out an edgy sound blurring funk, rock, blues, and jazz.  </div>
