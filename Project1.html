          <div id = "my"> About </div>
       
          <div id = "here"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WaterSeer Design Competition - A $12,000 Collider Competition cohosted by the Sutardja Dai Center for Entrepreneurship and VICI Labs. The goal was to create a proof of concept device which passively condenses water from ambient air. The criteria upon which this project was judged were manufacturability, construction cost, aesthetic appeal, effective yield, and the design's practical applicability to both high-end resorts and developing country markets.  </div>

          <div id = "my"> Solution  </div>

          <div id = "here"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our design consists of two modular systems. The first sub-system is an above-ground array of panels mimicking the geometries of the Lotus flower. The panels are designed to use a heat differential to facilitate condensation on the surface which is imprinted with hydrophillic and hydrophobic pattern that allows for droplets to flow into the sub-terranean well. The panels were designed to be incredibly easy to install and remove in the case of hurricane-speed winds. They snap on and off the the heat sink rod with a simple lift and twist due to the 3D Printed attachment mount that screws into the bottom of each aluminum panel. 
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second sub-system consists of a helical turbine to draw air into a sub-terranean system of piping. This piping performs the same radiative condensation as the panels, but is continually fed ambient hot air from above-ground. This method has a very high potential for water yield and numerous advantages; the foremost few being the separation of the condensed water from debris and animals, the capacity to generate 100% pure water to be stored immediately in a well below-ground, and that the system can run day and night with practically the same efficacy. </p>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution we devised has a relatively simple construction. It uses just two different sized turbines, a gearbox, and rods to connect and house the two. The gear ratio within the gearbox multiplied the angular velocity of the turbine to provide six times the rotational motion for the fan as for the turbine. In this respect, the turbine needed a design to maximize the utility of the wind flow around it, as the gear ratio increased the required torque to the turbine six-fold. To quell this issue, we proposed a large Gorlov Helical turbine, which is capable of utilizing wind flow from all directions.
            This turbine system provides more than just function, but elegance as well. With aesthetics being a large part of the judging criteria, it was crucial that this turbine commit artistic appeal to the whole structure. It completes the lotus-flower inspiration of the design— serving as the gorgeous and captivating stigma of the flower. </p> 
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We found our design to have a theoretical yield of 10 Liters per day, enough to meet the needs of a family of four. </p>

          <div id = "here"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took first prize in the 2016 WaterSeer Design Competition! VICI labs, the project's commissioners, are currently implementing the final design in Haiti with both the National Peace Corps Association and with high-end Marriott hotels around Port-au-Prince.
