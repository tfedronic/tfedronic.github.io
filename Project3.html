          <div id = "my"> Challenge  </div>
          
          <div id = "here"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project posed a comprehensive challenge; design, 
          model, build, and test a 3D-printed, fully functional, small-scale wind turbine. We were tasked with 
          designing a blade that could generate maximum power, as well as a support tower with an optimized 
          stiffness to weight ratio. These criteria mirror some of the most critical challenges faced in the 
          construction of commercial-grade wind generator turbines, an ever-more relevant concern in a world that 
          is turning increasingly to alternative energy.   </div>

          <div id = "my"> Design  </div>

          <div id = "here"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our design process focused on aerodynamic aspects of the 
          blade: the number of blades, the angle of the blade edges, airfoiling, and mass. For reasons described in the 
          Theory and Design sections of this report, we finally settled on a relatively heavy five-blade design with a 
          significant airfoil, giving the blade’s cross-section a slope of 10 degrees on the front and 17.5 degrees on the back. 
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the tower, our final design prioritized rigidity and aimed secondarily
            for lightness: a hollow cylindrical tube that narrows as it ascends, with a broad base. For added rigidity at a 
            minimal weight cost, we also included guylines made of an unspecified metal alloy, nuts and bolts, and 3D printed
            wire tensioners. Our design aimed for an efficient use of material, as well as clever design decisions, to maximize
            its desirable factors. </p>
            </div>

          <div id = "my"> Testing  </div>

          <div id = "here"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The testing process was composed of measuring power output with an 
          electrical meter (current, voltage, and power data were recorded under various electrical loading conditions), 
          measuring the rotations-per-minute using a meter and a reflective strip attached to the blade, weighing the tower
          using a scale, and testing the stiffness using weights, a pulley system, and a deflection dial-indicator. </div>
          <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The collected power output data was plotted and a quadratic least
          squares polynomial was fitted to the data. The maximum power on this regression curve was 1.8545 watts, or 19.1% of
          the theoretical maximum efficiency for an ideal turbine blade with the same swept area. The tower and blade assembly
          cost $167.20 and with with attached guy wires totaled in at a mass of 1364 grams. A least squares linear regression 
          of the load vs deflection data yielded that our tower achieved a stiffness of 29.768 N/mm. When divided by the 
          towers total mas, this yields a stiffness to mass ratio of 21.842 N/mmKg. </p>
          </div>


          <div id = "my"> Results  </div>

          <div id = "here"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tower achieved the highest stiffness to weight ratio in the 
          class. We were relatively successful in power output. We satisfied the conditions of the project to the best of 
          our technical ability, and as a cohesive team. We consciously made trade-offs in the weight category to make our
          tower structurally impressive. Our guy-wire system worked wonders to keep the top of the tower firmly postioned.
